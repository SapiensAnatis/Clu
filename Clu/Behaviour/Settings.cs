           to gleam mentions of roles/users). This is because keeping track of values if in JSON is very finnicky;
           I would have to store IDs and rework the whole class structure to allow for a value from the start. If
           stored as IDs, I would then have to implement more operations to get from IDs to IUser or IRole objects.
           
           It also means that the bot is less centralized - a user can be sure of what a setting's value is by looking
           at their own server - even if they don't have access to the running environment of the instance of the bot
           which they are using.
           
           My system is a bit crap as well, but I think it's better. If it doesn't work, you won't see this comment
           as I'll probably have rewritten this entirely; it's fundamentally incompatible with storing values in JSON. */
